# Introduction
"Shit in - shit out" was a comment, I often heard when it comes to deliveries which miss expectations. For several years, I earned my living by analysing these situations. I followed the invisible threads on both sides of the equitation.
Uncountable iterations later, I recognized a set of common issues which lead to great success as well as big failures. The line between is thin and therefore invisible for many people.
I accepted the call of duty, I recognized within and share insights on what I found to enable collateral benefits from it. Collateral benefits is what I call all these documentation I do primarly for myself and additional for all who are in a need and dare to make use from my shared knowledge.  
Remember, mastership is applied wisdom to the circumstances. I can share what I learned as knowledge. Some might see signs of wisdom within. Application is up to everybody else. You can do or go on straight away the way You always did.

I started with a solid education from school. These skills were intensified by studies of law and founding some Businesses, mostly IT-related. Years later, I wished to dive deeper into the topic of cooking. I wanted to escape from the prison, recipies and convenience products build around my ability in cooking. After diving deeper in the topic, I found some mastery represented by others. What I missed and still miss are the essentials of cooking. Even in the best books about this topic I found, I miss comprehensive discussion of the inner relationship between raw material in form of ingredients, technical appliance in form of the cooking itself and the results which might be intended and often are a bit of a random.

From my education in school I know for example, how amounts in relation to each other will effect results. You can make a clear broth from vegetables or bones. So, what is a broth then in comparison to a sauce and how cann You convert a vanilla sauce into a vanilla pudding? In the end, there are simularities and differences which are not as big as You might think if You buy a vanilla sauce as convenience product or a vanilla pudding as instant package where You only add milk and stir.

Now, Systems Thinking comes into the game. The result is defined by the circumstances. It is one side of the equitation, environment and components applied to each other are the other. Do You already knwo why it is impossible to hardboil eggs on the mount everest and why the liquid inside the air cooler of a water-cooled combustion engine does not boil at 120Â°C until You open up the valve on top of it?
It is all the same mechanics, following the principles described by science and could be witnessed by everybody every day.

My aim is nothing more than collecting these phenomenons, describing them as I observe them AND what I understand by this all together.

Feel free to attend my walk through the systematic world of cooking which could get You rid of the chains, strict recipes and convenience products lay around Your hands as well as around Your mind and prevent Yourself by expressing You personally - in cooking as in all other aspects You look at the world.

This is nothing against "The Industry". I like industrial processing, I am involved in several ways and I benefit from standardized and normalized products and the markets they are offered. My intend is to show, how availability of these products can boost You into another dimension of greatness. Take what You can get to climb on shoulders of those, You invested lots of effort in developing, testing and assuring of stable qualities. This is what You need to free Your mind from doubts about the material You use. Once, You entered the basic levels of mastership, You can vary. You can grow Your own vegetables and herbs. And maybe then, You can appreciate greatness resulting from stable flavor and qualities, industrial products offer.

It's about coexistence instead of fascism I refuse - in kitchen as well as everywhere else.

In German we say

> Liebe geht durch den Magen.
> (Love runs through stomach)

Enjoy, and delight Your beloved by Yourself and what You can share with them.
